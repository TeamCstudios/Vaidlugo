## History
Väidlugo was started in April 2018 as a fun project to make an esperantido with more international vocabulary and simpler phonology.

This language borrows vocabulary from many different languages, and the reasons for certain borrowings are sometimes arbitrary, and not always based on language size.

Version 1.0, or Proto-Väidlugo, laid the foundations of the phonology and vocabulary. It began development on April 11, and became obsolete on May 16.

Version 1.1, or Nova Väidlugo, simplified the orthography and phonology greatly by: 
Removing Digraphs
Making the language phonographemic (i.e. each symbol has one sound)
Defining the glottal stop as phonemic.
1.1 started on May 16 and became obsolete on May 17.

Version 1.2, also known as Sarja Väidlugo, took the language in a different direction. It added the “Sarcastic Mood,” along with five new accented letters to use in sarcastic situations. The only remnant of this change in 1.3+ is “sare” which is an adverb used to denote a sarcastic sentence. 1.2 started on May 17 and ended on July 11.

Version 1.3, “Novakreido Väidlugo” was created as a wholesale reform of both the mood system and the phonology. It removed the mood system and merged /f~v~w/ and /s~z/, and also added multiple words from Mandarin. 1.3 started on July 11 and became obsolete with 2.0 on August 9.

Version 2.0 was started on August 7 and released August 9th. It removes the apostrophe and removes the glottal stop as a phoneme. It also borrows more vocabulary from languages not seen in Väidlugo before. It became obsolete on September 15th.

Version 2.1 was released on September 15th. It simplified consonant clusters and added new vocabulary.
